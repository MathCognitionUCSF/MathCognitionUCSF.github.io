# Math Cognition team at UCSF 

We are a new [**multidisciplinary team**](/team) at UCSF studying the typical and atypical development of math abilities.\
Our goals:
* **Identify** children at risk for math difficulties prior to elementary school.
* **Discover** the neural basis of different subtypes of math differences.
* **Develop** neuroscience-based interventions specifically tailored to individual profiles.

We are partnering with the [**UCSF Dyslexia Center**](https://dyslexia.ucsf.edu/) to create a new [**Math Neuroscience and Education Program**](/math_program). This multidisciplinary partnership is crucial for young learners because research shows that 40-60% of children with dyslexia have math difficulties, and likewise, 40-60% of children with [**dyscalculia**](/dyscalculia/) have reading challenges. Identification of co-occurring learning challenges may help lead to improved treatment for both difficulties.

Research also indicates that **many children with dyslexia excel in math**, especially in non-symbolic, visuospatial and geometrical reasoning. With proper evaluation, children can leverage these skills in the classroom and in life.

Therefore, we believe that a **detailed assessment** of math abilities in children at risk for dyslexia or formally diagnosed with dyslexia will help us better understand math learning differences and design **effective interventions** to mitigate the challenges faced by children struggling with math.
