### What is dyscalculia? 
Current research suggest that learning difficulties rarely occur in isolation and are therefore better conceptualized as a collection of phenotypes that involve a variety of academic domains. Recent studies have demonstrated that 40-60% of children with dyslexia also present with math difficulties. Developmental dyscalculia is a specific learning difficulty affecting the acquisition of elementary mathematical skills, such as quantity processing (e.g. estimating the number of spectators in a stadium), calculation (e.g. mentally solving 53-14), arithmetic facts (e.g. the multiplication table) and geometrical reasoning (e.g. comparing the angles of a triangle). For an excellent review about Dyscalculia, see this [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1201536) paper.

### Specific Aims 
In order to better understand, prevent and alleviate math difficulties, we are planning to establish a new Math Neuroscience and Education Program within the UCSF Dyslexia Center. The Program will have three main goals: 
* Identify children at risk prior to elementary school.
* Discover the neural basis of different subtypes of dyscalculia. 
* Develop neuroscience-based interventions specifically tailored to individual profiles.

### How?
Traditionally, research has focused on a small number of specific brain regions and solely on cognitive weaknesses. Our framework, on the other hand, considers the whole brain network organization and aims at discovering the potential cognitive and emotional strengths of children with dyscalculia. We plan to use a multimethodological approach, combining data from:
* Neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging - fMRI).
* Neuropsychology (standardized tests of attention, memory, executive functions).
* Physiology (heart rate, respiration)
* Education (standardized tests of academic achievement)
* Socioeconomics (socioeconomical status, first language)
* Emotional (general anxiety, math anxiety and depression questionnaires)

### What do we need to accomplish our goals? 
We plan to create a variety of technological products that can be deployed in large-scale and combined with other initiatives that collaborate with the UCSF Dyslexia Center, namely: Multitudes and Bench to School. 
* A web-based assessment platform with child-friendly gamified battery of tests to investigate elementary math abilities. This goal of this platform is to identify children at risk for dyscalculia, to characterize the individual math difficulties profiles and to measure the efficacy of interventions. 
* A Math Intervention APP based on neuroscientific findings from our Program.
* Workshops to train math teachers about the neural basis of math abilities, as well as how to use the web-based assessment platform and Math Intervention APP.
