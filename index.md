# Math Cognition UCSF 

We are a new multidisciplinary [**team**](/team) at UCSF studying the typical and atypical development of math abilities. Our goals are:

* Identify children at risk for math difficulties prior to elementary school.
* Discover the neural basis of different subtypes of math differences. 
* Develop neuroscience-based interventions specifically tailored to individual profiles.

We are partnering with the [UCSF Dyslexia Center](https://dyslexia.ucsf.edu/) to create a new [**Math Neuroscience and Education Program**](/math_program). This is important, because current research shows that 40-60% of children with dyslexia also present with math difficulties. Likewise, 40-60% of children with [**dyscalculia**](/dyscalculia/) also have reading challenges.

On the other hand, **many children with dyslexia are actually extremelly good at math**, especially for non-symbolic, visuospatial and geometrical reasoning. 

Therefore we believe that a detailed assessment of math abilities will help us better undersdand these learning differences and design more effective interventions to aliviate the suffering of chidlren and their families.
