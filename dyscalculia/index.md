### What is dyscalculia? 
Developmental dyscalculia is a specific learning difficulty affecting the acquisition of elementary mathematical skills, such as:
* Quantity processing (e.g. estimating the number of spectators in a stadium) 
* Calculation (e.g. mentally solving 53-14)
* Arithmetic facts (e.g. the multiplication table) 
* Geometrical reasoning (e.g. comparing the angles of a triangle). 

For an excellent review about Dyscalculia, see this [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1201536) paper. 

Current research suggest that learning difficulties rarely occur in isolation and are therefore better conceptualized as a collection of phenotypes that involve a variety of academic domains. Recent studies have demonstrated that 40-60% of children with **dyslexia** also present with math difficulties. 

For more information about the brain regions involved in dyscalculia, see below Prof. Pinheiro-Chagas' slides for the event **Neuroscience in Action** on Sep 30th 2022:
