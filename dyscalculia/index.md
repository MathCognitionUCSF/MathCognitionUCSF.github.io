## What is dyscalculia? 
**Developmental dyscalculia** is a specific learning difficulty affecting the acquisition of elementary mathematical skills, such as:
* Quantity processing (e.g. estimating the number of spectators in a stadium) 
* Calculation (e.g. solving '53-14=39' without a paper)
* Arithmetic facts (e.g. the multiplication table) 
* Geometrical reasoning (e.g. comparing the angles of a triangle). 

Children with dyscalculia have these difficulties despite adequate intellectual abilities, appropriate neurologic development, and schooling opportunities. 

* **Dyscalculia affects 5-7% of the pupulation**, similarly to dyslexia. 
* The **annual cost of low numeracy** in the **UK** is **>Â£2.4 billion**. 
* **Improvement** in 0.5 standard deviation in **math performance increases GDP per capita** of 0.87%

### Co-occurence between math and reading difficultites

Current research suggest that learning difficulties rarely occur in isolation and are therefore better conceptualized as a collection of phenotypes that involve a variety of academic domains. Recent studies have demonstrated that 40-60% of children with **dyslexia** also present with math difficulties.

**Note that left hemisphere contains many more regions dedicated to reading!**

#### Compare it to the right hemisphere
(This is the middle of the brain, try moving it around!)

### Currently, there is no consensus about: 
* [The diagnostic criteria for dyscalculia](/math_battery)
* [The most effective interventions](/interventions)

### But our multidisciplinary [team](/team) at UCSF is working on it!
