title: What is dyscalculia?

## What is dyscalculia? 
**Developmental dyscalculia** is a specific learning difficulty affecting the acquisition of elementary mathematical skills, such as:
* **Quantity processing** (e.g. estimating the number of spectators in a stadium) 
* **Calculation** (e.g. solving '53-14=39' without paper)
* **Arithmetic facts** (e.g. the multiplication table) 
* **Geometrical reasoning** (e.g. comparing the angles of a triangle). 

Children with dyscalculia struggle in these domains, despite intellectual ability, typical neurological development, and strong educational opportunity.

* [**Dyscalculia affects 3-6% of the population**, similar to dyslexia.](shalev_prevalence.pdf) 
* [**Low numeracy** is associated with poor financial well-being.](low_numeracy.pdf) 
* [**Improvement** by one standard deviation in **math proficiency translates into 12% increase in wages**.](https://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/Country%20note%20-%20United%20States.pdf)


Low numeracy is estimated to have similar or potentially higher costs to individuals and society compared to low literacy. Yet, dyscalculia is studied disproportionately less than dyslexia. This disparity is reflected in the number of publications on [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) for dyslexia vs. dyscalculia over time. See below:

### Co-occurence between math and reading difficultites

Current research suggests that learning difficulties rarely occur in isolation and are therefore better conceptualized as a collection of phenotypes involving a variety of academic domains. Recent studies have demonstrated that 40-60% of children with **dyslexia** also present with math difficulties.

### Currently, there is no consensus about: 
* [The diagnostic criteria for dyscalculia](/math_battery)
* [The most effective interventions](/interventions)

### But our multidisciplinary [team](/team) at UCSF is working on it!
