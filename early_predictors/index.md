title: Early predictors of math

## Early predictos of math abillities 

One of the main goals of the [**Math Neuroscience and Education Program**](/math_program/) is to **identify children at risk** for math learning differences *before elementary school*. We believe that understanding the ***root causes*** of math challenges *early* in the development will better inform [effective interventions](/interventions). 

In order to acomplish this goal, we are going to develop a *web-based assessment platform* specifically designed to be child-friendly and deployable in large scale. This platoform will host a variety of gamified tasks that have been shown to be robust predictors of math achievement in children *(**math primitives**)*.

We are also going to include some new experimental tasks that we belive constitute the *cognitive start-up tools* for human ***symbolic reasoning*** *(i.e. reading, math, music, programming)*. One of our hypothesis is that these ***logical primities*** will be powerful measures to explain the co-occurences between ***math*** and ***reading*** challenges.
